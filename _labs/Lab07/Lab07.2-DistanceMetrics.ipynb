    "The previous labs we discussed ways to measure relationships between variables, or the _columns_ of a `DataFrame`. This chapter is about how to measure relationships between observations, or the _rows_ of a `DataFrame`. How do we quantify how \"similar\" two observations are? We will use the Ames housing data set, but to keep things simple, we will work with just three quantitative variables from that data set: the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the living area (in square feet)."

    "Binary categorical variables (categorical variables with two categories) can be converted into quantitative variables by coding one category as 1 and the other category as 0. (In fact, the `survived` column in the Titanic data set is an example of a variable where this has been done.) But what do we do about a categorical variable with more than 2 categories, like `embarked`, which has 3 categories?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can convert a categorical variable with $K$ categories into $K$ separate 0/1 variables, or **dummy variables**. Each of the $K$ variables is an indicator for one of the $K$ categories. That is, each dummy variable is 1 if the observation fell into that category and 0 otherwise.\n",
